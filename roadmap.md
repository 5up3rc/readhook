# Roadmap
This is a rough roadmap for the project.

## v1: Current version
This is the first 'get up and running' version. As a result, many aspects are either hard coded or bundled together.

## v2: Re-factor
The next iteration will split out the payload analysis and generation code from the synthetic vulnerability.

## v3: Auto-generation of payloads
In this release, we will use the EnViz project (https://github.com/polyverse/binary-entropy-visualizer) to automatically create payloads.

## v4: Configuratable vulnerabilities
Make it easeir to exploit different types of vulnerabilities (e.g. use after free, etc.) versus a standard buffer overflow.
